# Housing Analytics Dashboard

This repository contains Tableau dashboards for analyzing housing data, providing insights into housing prices, room configurations, and property sizes across different localities and property types in NYC area.

## Dashboards

The project includes three main dashboards:

1.  **Housing Price Analytics:**
    * **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive overview of housing prices, allowing users to filter by average price, property type, sub-locality, and locality.
    * **Key Metrics:** Average price, top locality by price, highest price, and price distribution by county.
    * **Visualizations:** Bar charts showing average prices by county, a price distribution map, and a price table detailing individual listings.
    * **Example Image:** 'Housing Price Dashboard.png'

2.  **Housing Room Analytics:**
    * **Purpose:** Focuses on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in properties, enabling analysis based on average bed and bath count, property type, sub-locality, and locality.
    * **Key Metrics:** Average bed and bath count, top locality by bed and bath, highest bed and bath count, and bed and bath distribution by county.
    * **Visualizations:** Bar charts displaying average bed and bath counts by county, a property square feet distribution map (though labeled as such, it visualizes bed/bath distribution), and a bed and bath table for specific listings.
    * **Example Image:** 'Housing Room Dashboard.png'

3.  **Housing Size Analytics:**
    * **Purpose:** Analyzes properties based on their square footage, with filters for average property size, type, sub-locality, and locality.
    * **Key Metrics:** Average property square feet, top locality by property square feet, highest property square feet, and property size distribution by county.
    * **Visualizations:** Bar charts illustrating average property square feet by county, a property square feet distribution map, and a property square feet table with listing details.
    * **Example Image:** 'Housing Size Dashboard.png'

## Features

* **Interactive Filters:** Easily narrow down data by average price, average bed and bath, average property square feet, property type, sub-locality, and locality.
* **Locality-Based Insights:** View top localities by price, bed/bath, and property square feet.
* **Distribution Maps:** Visualize price, bed/bath, and property size distribution across different counties.
* **Detailed Tables:** Access specific listing information including broker title, sub-locality, street name, and key metrics.
* **Type-Based Analysis:** Understand how different property types (e.g., townhouse, condo, foreclosure) influence various housing metrics.
